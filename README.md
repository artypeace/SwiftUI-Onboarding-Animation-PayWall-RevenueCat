For confetti animation I use [ConfettiSwiftUI](https://github.com/simibac/ConfettiSwiftUI). It's available as a [Swift Package](https://swift.org/package-manager/). 
To integrate `ConfettiSwiftUI` into your Xcode project using Xcode, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/simibac/ConfettiSwiftUI.git, :branch="master"
```
